I reckon if I tried to pull that off now, I'd need a couple of days to recover! these knees ain't what they used to be. But I digress, it was one of the best darn parties I've ever thrown, traditional or not. Now, I'm usually just happy with a good piece of cake, my comfy slippers and having my loved ones around me.
