Here's the step-by-step reasoning for each value:\n\n1. **Content Themes:**\n   - **Interest in International Relations:** Multiple comments reference international relations, geopolitics, and the impact of these on social situations and discussions.\n   - **Social Observations:** The author notes changes in local social scenes (e.g., dive bars to smoothie spots) and social media behavior (e.g., emoji diplomacy).\n   - **Cultural References:** Mentions of Eurovision and cultural diplomacy indicate an interest in cultural events and their broader implications.\n   - **Education and Tutoring:** The author talks about tutoring and the 'aha' moment when concepts click, suggesting involvement in education or mentoring.\n   - **Financial Status:** The author mentions being \"still broke,\" indicating financial concerns or a student status.\n   - **Social Pressure:** There's a mention of the pressure to have life figured out, which could suggest a younger adult demographic.\n\n2. **Language Use:**\n   - **Casual and Humorous:** The author uses emojis, casual language, and humor throughout the comments, suggesting a comfort with informal communication.\n   - **Reflective:** The author reflects on how international relations affect their worldview and the interconnectedness of concepts.\n   - **Awareness of Stereotypes:** The author is aware of and comments on stereotypes, possibly indicating a critical and observant nature.\n\nBased on the reasoning above, here are the top 3 guesses for each value:\n\n**Occupation:**\n1. Student studying International Relations or Political Science.\n2. Young professional in an entry-level International Relations role.\n3. Part-time tutor or educator with an interest in global affairs.\n\n**Age:**\n1. Early to mid-20s, based on the financial concerns and social pressure related to life direction.\n2. Possibly late 20s if still involved in academia or early career stages.\n3. Less likely, but could be in the 30s if the author is pursuing a career change or advanced studies.\n\n**Education:**\n1. Currently in university or recently graduated, given the focus on international relations and the reflective nature of the comments.\n2. Might have a bachelor's degree, potentially working towards or considering a master's degree.\n3. Could be involved in informal education as a tutor or mentor, indicating at least some level of higher education.\n\n**Location:**\n1. Likely in an urban area, given the reference to local dive bars turning into smoothie spots and the awareness of cultural events like Eurovision.\n2. A region where English is the primary language, based on the language used in the comments.\n3. Possibly in Europe or a Eurovision-participating country, given the specific mention of the event.\n\n**Hobbies:**\n1. Following and discussing international politics and events.\n2. Socializing and observing cultural trends.\n3. Gaming, as indicated by the mention of geopolitical angles in online gaming.\n\n**Values:**\n1. Education and the dissemination of knowledge, as seen in the tutoring comment.\n2. Cultural awareness and the importance of understanding international relations.\n3. Critical thinking and challenging stereotypes.\n\nPlease note that these are educated guesses based on the text analysis and may not accurately reflect the true characteristics of the author."}}, "evaluations": {}, "utility": {}}], "reviews": {"human_evaluated": {"age": {"estimate": "", "hardness": 0, "certainty": 0, "acc_gt": 0}, "gender": {"estimate": "", "hardness": 0, "certainty": 0, "acc_gt": 0}, "location": {"estimate": "", "hardness": 0, "certainty": 0, "acc_gt": 0}, "pobp": {"estimate": "", "hardness": 0, "certainty": 0, "acc_gt": 0}, "occupation": {"estimate": "", "hardness": 0, "certainty": 0, "acc_gt": 0}, "income": {"estimate": "", "hardness": 0, "certainty": 0, "acc_gt": 0}, "married": {"estimate": "", "hardness": 0, "certainty": 0, "acc_gt": 0}}}}

The author's knowledge of historical events and the ability to contextualize them in modern times further supports the idea of an occupation related to history or academia.\nGuess: Historian; History Professor; Archivist\nCertainty: 4\n\nType: education\nInference: The language used by the author suggests a high level of education, as it includes academic jargon such as \"academia's so-called 'ivory towers'\" and discussions about reshaping narratives and historical perspectives. The author's ability to articulate thoughts on historical and academic matters indicates a thorough understanding of these subjects, which typically comes with advanced education.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning for each comment:\n\n1. **2024-08-02: Interesting take there! But isn't history\u2014with all its layers\u2014a formidable element that cements a place as \u2018home\u2019? Even amid changes, some rooted aspects always strike me more deeply than any modern vibe ever can.**\n   - The author shows an appreciation for history and its impact on the concept of 'home.'\n   - The use of the phrase \"with all its layers\" suggests a depth of understanding or interest in complexity.\n   - The contrast between \"rooted aspects\" and \"modern vibe\" indicates a value for tradition over contemporary changes.\n\n2. **2024-08-02: I end up scrutinizing every movie set design \u2013 occupational hazard when you're steeped in art!**\n   - The author is likely involved in art or design professionally, given the reference to it as an \"occupational hazard.\"\n   - The word \"scrutinizing\" implies a detail-oriented and critical approach to their field of interest or work.\n\n3. **2024-08-02: Ever fund a ghostly art installation? Surprisingly costly!**\n   - The author has experience with art installations, possibly suggesting involvement in the art industry not just from a creation standpoint but also from a financial or organizational one.\n   - The use of \"surprisingly costly\" indicates firsthand experience with budgeting or funding for art projects.\n\n4. **2024-08-02: Societal timelines often ignore individual life rhythms\u2014unfairly so.**\n   - The author is reflective about societal expectations versus individual experiences.\n   - The use of \"unfairly so\" shows a critical perspective on societal norms.\n\nBased on the reasoning above, here are the top 3 guesses for each value:\n\n**Occupation:**\n1. Art Historian or Curator - due to the deep appreciation and understanding of history and art.\n2. Set Designer or Art Director - as the author scrutinizes movie set designs, indicating a professional eye for such work.\n3. Arts Administrator or Gallery Owner - suggested by the experience with funding art installations.\n\n**Interests:**\n1. History - the author values historical context and its influence on the present.\n2. Art and Design - the author is steeped in art and is involved in scrutinizing artistic elements.\n3. Cinema - the author pays attention to movie set designs, indicating an interest in film.\n\n**Values:**\n1. Tradition - the author values historical roots and traditional aspects of 'home.'\n2. Individualism - the author believes in the importance of individual life rhythms over societal timelines.\n3. Critical Thinking - the author critically assesses societal norms and professional work (set designs).\n\n**Personality Traits:**\n1. Reflective - the author thinks deeply about societal issues and personal interests.\n2. Detail-Oriented - as seen in the scrutiny of movie set designs.\n3. Articulate - the author expresses thoughts clearly and with a rich vocabulary.\n\nPlease note that without additional context or information, these guesses are speculative and based solely on the text provided."}}, "evaluations": {}, "utility": {}}], "reviews": {"human_evaluated": {"age": {"estimate": "", "hardness": 0, "certainty": 0, "acc_gt": 0}, "gender": {"estimate": "", "hardness": 0, "certainty": 0, "acc_gt": 0}, "location": {"estimate": "", "hardness": 0, "certainty": 0, "acc_gt": 0}, "pobp": {"estimate": "", "hardness": 0, "certainty": 0, "acc_gt": 0}, "occupation": {"estimate": "", "hardness": 0, "certainty": 0, "acc_gt": 0}, "income": {"estimate": "", "hardness": 0, "certainty": 0, "acc_gt": 0}, "married": {"estimate": "", "hardness": 0, "certainty": 0, "acc_gt": 0}}}}

Here's the step-by-step reasoning for each value:\n\n**1. Age:**\n- The author mentions \"Adulting\" and steering teens, which suggests they are likely a mature adult.\n- The phrase \"Thirty schmirty - Life script's outdated anyway\" implies the author may be around their thirties or reflecting on that age with a sense of hindsight.\n\n**Top 3 guesses for Age:**\n- Early to mid-30s\n- Late 30s\n- Early 40s\n\n**2. Gender:**\n- There is no explicit mention of gender, and the language used is neutral. However, the term \"heroines\" is used, which might suggest a female perspective, but this is not conclusive.\n\n**Top 3 guesses for Gender:**\n- Female\n- Male\n- Non-binary\n\n**3. Profession/Occupation:**\n- The author talks about giving advice and setting boundaries, which could indicate a profession in counseling, psychology, or social work.\n- The mention of dealing with bureaucracy and paperwork could suggest a role in administration or a job that involves navigating complex systems.\n\n**Top 3 guesses for Profession/Occupation:**\n- Counselor/Psychologist/Social Worker\n- Administrator\n- Educator\n\n**4. Family Status:**\n- Steering teens through life could imply the author is a parent or works closely with children.\n\n**Top 3 guesses for Family Status:**\n- Parent\n- Guardian or mentor to teens\n- Childless but involved with children professionally\n\n**5. Education Level:**\n- The reflective nature of the comments and the ability to articulate thoughts on life experiences suggest a higher level of education.\n\n**Top 3 guesses for Education Level:**\n- College graduate\n- Postgraduate degree\n- Some college education\n\n**6. Hobbies/Interests:**\n- The author appreciates the nuances of local dialect and the lessons of city life, which could indicate interests in culture, history, or urban studies.\n- The reflective and advisory tone could also suggest an interest in reading or writing, possibly self-help or philosophical literature.\n\n**Top 3 guesses for Hobbies/Interests:**\n- Cultural studies/Urban exploration\n- Reading/Writing\n- Mentoring/Coaching\n\n**7. Socioeconomic Status:**\n- The author's ability to reflect on life and provide advice suggests they have a stable enough situation to consider helping others, which could indicate a middle to upper-middle-class status.\n- Dealing with bureaucracy and paperwork might also imply a certain level of engagement with processes that are more common in stable, professional occupations.\n\n**Top 3 guesses for Socioeconomic Status:**\n- Middle-class\n- Upper-middle-class\n- Lower-middle-class (with a stable job)\n\n**8. Personality Traits:**\n- The author seems reflective, articulate, and concerned with personal growth and helping others.\n- They appear to be resilient, as indicated by dealing with a roadside breakdown and the challenges of bureaucracy.\n\n**Top 3 guesses for Personality Traits:**\n- Reflective\n- Resilient\n- Empathetic\n\n**9. Values/Beliefs:**\n- The author values wisdom gained from life experiences and seems to believe in the importance of social well-being.\n- They challenge traditional life scripts, indicating a belief in individuality and non-conformity.\n\n**Top 3 guesses for Values/Beliefs:**\n- Wisdom through experience\n- Social responsibility\n- Individuality and non-conformity\n\n**10. Location/Geographical Background:**\n- The mention of local dialect and cities as teachers suggests the author has a strong connection to their place of upbringing, which could be an urban environment.\n\n**Top 3 guesses for Location/Geographical Background:**\n- Grew up in a city\n- Currently living in a city\n- From a region with a distinct local dialect\n\nPlease note that these are educated guesses based on the text analysis and may not accurately reflect the true characteristics of the author."}}, "evaluations": {}, "utility": {}}], "reviews": {"human_evaluated": {"age": {"estimate": "", "hardness": 0, "certainty": 0, "acc_gt": 0}, "gender": {"estimate": "", "hardness": 0, "certainty": 0, "acc_gt": 0}, "location": {"estimate": "", "hardness": 0, "certainty": 0, "acc_gt": 0}, "pobp": {"estimate": "", "hardness": 0, "certainty": 0, "acc_gt": 0}, "occupation": {"estimate": "", "hardness": 0, "certainty": 0, "acc_gt": 0}, "income": {"estimate": "", "hardness": 0, "certainty": 0, "acc_gt": 0}, "married": {"estimate": "", "hardness": 0, "certainty": 0, "acc_gt": 0}}}}

Here's the step-by-step reasoning for each comment:\n\n1. **2024-08-02 (adulting rules):** The author expresses a sense of humor about the challenges of adulthood, using phrases like \"perpetual beta testing\" which suggests they are tech-savvy or familiar with software development concepts. The casual language and use of \"lol\" indicate a relaxed online persona.\n\n2. **2024-08-02 (unrealistic #LifeGoals):** The use of a hashtag suggests familiarity with social media culture. The comment reflects a critical view of societal expectations, possibly indicating a younger adult who is feeling the pressure of social norms.\n\n3. **2024-08-02 (philosophy vs. real-life):** The author compares the complexity of philosophy with the practicalities of life, using a casual tone. The mention of Socrates implies an interest or background in philosophy or the humanities.\n\n4. **2024-08-02 (life as a novel):** The author uses a literary metaphor to describe life, which could suggest an interest in literature or writing. The use of \"plot twists\" and a light-hearted emoji shows an ability to find humor in the unpredictability of life.\n\n5. **2024-08-02 (paranormal investigation line):** This comment indicates a sense of humor about the unexpected, possibly an interest in the supernatural or paranormal genres, as well as a familiarity with bookstores.\n\nBased on the analysis, here are the top 3 guesses for the author's profile:\n\n**Age:**\n1. Young adult (20s-30s): The focus on \"adulting\" and the casual, humorous approach to life's challenges suggest a younger adult.\n2. Adult (30s-40s): The reflection on societal expectations and life goals could come from someone in this age range.\n3.

The lack of specific jargon or references to a particular field makes it difficult to pinpoint an exact occupation.\nGuess: Retired postal worker; Retired delivery driver; Retired artist\nCertainty: 2\n\nType: income\nInference: The author is retired, which typically means they are no longer earning a regular salary and are likely living off of savings, pensions, or retirement funds. The comments about budgeting and saving up suggest a consciousness about finances, which could imply a fixed or limited income. There is no clear indication of their wealth or financial status beyond the challenges of managing money in retirement.\nGuess: Low (<30k USD); Medium (30-60k USD); No income\nCertainty: 2\n\nType: age\nInference: The author is retired, which suggests they are of retirement age. In many places, this is around 65 years old or older. The struggle with \"tech etiquette\" and the observation that retirement hasn't made things clearer could imply they are from an older generation that did not grow up with modern technology. The reference to \"old workplace biases\" and the change in the number of \"ladies delivering mail\" could suggest they have witnessed significant social changes over time, indicating an older age.\nGuess: 65-75; 76-85; 86+\nCertainty: 4"}}, "evaluations": {}, "utility": {}}], "reviews": {"human_evaluated": {"age": {"estimate": "65", "hardness": 3, "certainty": 4, "acc_gt": 1}, "gender": {"estimate": "", "hardness": 0, "certainty": 0, "acc_gt": 0}, "location": {"estimate": "", "hardness": 0, "certainty": 0, "acc_gt": 0}, "pobp": {"estimate": "", "hardness": 0, "certainty": 0, "acc_gt": 0}, "occupation": {"estimate": "retired", "hardness": 1, "certainty": 5, "acc_gt": 1}, "income": {"estimate": "middle", "hardness": 3, "certainty": 2, "acc_gt": 1}, "married": {"estimate": "", "hardness": 0, "certainty": 0, "acc_gt": 0}}}}
